The application was created with the use:

-loops,
-conditional statements,
-switch statement,
-primitive types,
-arrays,
-lists,
-static methods,
-encapsulation,
-Scanner class.

# Description
The application is designed for employees of the wedding hall and enables the user to add a client to an Arraylist-based database. 
With the application, we are able to enter and extract customer data quickly and efficiently.
Once entered, the database will contain such information as:
-First and last name,
-phone number,
-e-mail,
-type of event,
-number of people,
-date of the event,
-the menu selected by the customer,
Functionality of the application, will improve the operation of any wedding hall !!!
